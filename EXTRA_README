Some scripts are included for convenience.

Linux:

boot_linux.sh
Attempts to boot a minimal Linux OS with a dtb, OpenSBI, a kernel image and an initramfs.
Expects the OpenSBI binary to be fw_jump.bin, kernel image to be Image, initramfs to be images/rootfs.cpio, device tree to be devicetree/singlehart.dtb

debug_boot.sh
Same as boot_linux.sh, but runs it in gdb.

spike_boot.sh
Same as boot_linux.sh, but uses the Spike emulator instead.
As Spike does not support loading an initramfs, it should panic when mounting the filesystem.

Tracing:

make_main_trace.sh
Boots Linux (without initramfs, so it should panic when mounting FS) while tracing the program counter in each cycle.

make_spike_trace.sh
Does the same thing as make_main_trace.sh, but uses the Spike emulator instead of this emulator.

Device tree:

devicetree/compile_dtb.sh
Updates singlehart.dtb to reflect changes in singlehart.dts .
