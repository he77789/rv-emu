misaligned reservations may not work correctly

OUTDATED: this was previously true, but performance has since been improved by optimizations
PMP causes a heavy hit on performance
~70MHz without PMP, using -O3, context switches
~100MHz without PMP, using -O3, tight loop

~8MHz with PMP, using -O3, with naive first bit finding, context switches
~31MHz with PMP, using -O3, with ffsll, context switches
~49MHz with PMP, using -O3, with ffsll, tight loop

After consolidating PMP checks of multi-byte reads:
~33MHz using -O0, tight loop
~51MHz using -Os, tight loop
~67MHz using -O2, tight loop
~72MHz using -O3, tight loop
~53MHz using -O3, context switches
